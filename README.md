# HOW THIS PROJECT WORKS
This project works by recording a clip of your voice and storing it in the file explorer as a .wav file
for later use. It uses pythons SpeechRecognition library in order to achieve this and uses Tkinter for a 
user interface. 
# STEPS TO USE THE APPLICATION
1. Load up the application by running it in PyCharm an IDE that focuses on the python programing language
2. Navigate through until you hit Record New Audio 
3. Press the button to record new audio at this point you'll want to wait until the speak anything prompt appears
on PyCharms run console to know when to speak and keep the phrase short. During the creation of this project I
noticed the recording of an audio clip can be a little unrefined and during my time developing this project was 
unable to improve this aspect. You will also be able to tell that the application is recording through the use of
the Record New Audio button lighting up blue once this stops the application will stop the recording 
4. Now you should be able to navigate to File Explorer and find the .wav file that was created through the use 
of this application and play it back to hear your voice.
# PROJECT ENVISIONMENT
This is a final year project that I developed during my time at university. The problem I attempted to 
tackle during the course of this project is Voice Recognition and how it could be used during day to day 
practices. I felt this needed a solution because voice authentication is a branch of Biometric Authentication 
that can be just as useful as other forms of this security such as fingerprint or iris. I set out to make an 
application that could run an audio clip against one already stored in a database, so that it could print out 
a matching result. I went about this project through the use of programming a solution. However, I didnâ€™t quite 
manage to achieve what I initially set out to do as I underestimated just how much time I would need to complete
this task based on the abilities I needed to learn. So, during the course of the project I ended up switching 
over to a more Voice Recognition based approach to recording a single voice rather than pursuing the route of 
Voice Authentication.
